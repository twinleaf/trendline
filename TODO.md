Project TODO List
This document outlines the current bugs, desired features, and code quality improvements for the Trendline application.

üêû Bug Fixes

[ ] Mismatched Sample Rates: Investigate why selecting data streams with different sample rates results in NaN values, with behavior dependent on the selection order.

[ ] Cursor Behavior: Fix the plot cursor to correctly select the nearest non-null data point, instead of just the nearest x-coordinate.

[ ] FFT Data Source: Resolve the issue where the FFT calculation fails for data series that are not the primary X component (column index 0) and for IMU data streams.

[ ] Plot Resizing: Determine why adding a new plot to the view causes all existing plots to shrink slightly.

[ ] Proxy Reconnect Loop: Fix the bug where a reconnecting proxy spawns a new, independent proxy instance, leading to multiple reconnection timers.

‚ú® Features

[ ] Scalar Data Viewer: Implement exponential moving average and a boxed display for scalar values

[ ] Device Selector UI: Implement the pop-up modal for device selection, triggered from the "Change Device" menu item.

[ ] Device Selector manual URL input: Implement text entry option for device selection.

[ ] RPC Settings Panel: Create a dedicated UI for viewing and modifying device RPC parameters.

[ ] Plot Settings Tab: Add a tab panel within the settings modal (cog wheel) for adjusting plot-specific configurations (eg. colors, disable/enable plot title, window length)

[ ] Channel Search Bar: Implement a search bar in the channel selection interface to allow users to quickly filter available data streams.

[ ] Plot Reordering: Add functionality to allow users to drag and drop plots to reorder their display.

[ ] Data Logging: Add functionality to record binary data stream and eventually restream data as a headless device

[ ] TCP Proxy: Replicate functionality in `tio-proxy` as a checkbox on device discovery and in the MenuBar toggle setting

üõ†Ô∏è Code Quality & Refactoring

[ ] Reactive Data Flow:

Goal: Transition from a polling-based model to a reactive, event-driven architecture.

Implementation Idea: Instead of a single confirm_selection command, use atomic backend events (connect_stream, disconnect_stream). The frontend plots would subscribe to the relevant data streams, and the backend would push updates. This decouples the UI from managing connection state logic.

[ ] State Management Consolidation:

Goal: Clean up component-level TypeScript logic by moving it into the centralized chartState and deviceState stores.

Implementation Idea: Break down the monolithic chartState into smaller, modular uPlot configuration managers. This will simplify state management and make it easier to integrate with the new plot settings panels.

‚ùì Things to refactor

[ ] Move serialize `match rpc_type` into helper inside `twinleaf` crate
[ ] Move `RpcMeta` into... somewhere (maybe `twinleaf::meta` but it's not relevant to `proto`)
[ ] Move `device_enumerate()` into a `twinleaf` `util.rs` or something
